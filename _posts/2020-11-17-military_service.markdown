Last week, I finished my four-week basic training at Nonsan training center and I am currently working at a daycare center for the disabled.
People using the daycare center have severe intellectual disability and are aged between 30 ~ 40.
Although they are way older than me, their intellect is of an age between 6 to 10.

It's been almost a week since I started working here.
