This summer was my last summer as a university student and since I don't have plans on graduate school at the moment, it may be the last summer as a student.
Overall, it was quite a busy summer due to two internships.

In the first internship, I got a chance to write a software design document on a PaaS of digital biomarkers.
In the process of writing up, I learned about microservice architectures where in simple terms, the way I understood it, structuralizes an application into smaller independent services.
I think it resembles a lot with the Unix Philosophy where it tries to make things simple and excel at the one and only task it is given.

In the second internship, I got a chance to work at quite a big company and it was my first time working surrounded by so many people.
It certainly was very different from my previous internships.
In other internships, I would just go straight to work on day 1, but on this one, we spent a week on orientation to get to know the history, company values, other interns, and lots and lots about the company.
It almost felt like walking into another society inside a society.

During the internship, I made an internal tool to visualize the stats of a gNB(5G) Distributed Unit.
Although I had taken a course in computer networks, the materials related to 5G were in the lower layers (link layer and physical layer) than what I was familiar with.
I liked it a lot since it was very close to hardware, but I think I would need some time to fully grasp what was going on.
Thankfully, my project didn't require full understanding of the subject so I was able to complete it with ease.

One of the things I noticed was the amount of security procedures to prevent the leakage of valuable company assets.
Some procedures that I remember were covering the cameras on my phone and accessing the web through the corporate proxy.
It didn't feel cumbersome as I know the importance of security, but I think there were still some ways an adversary could get in.

Overall, it was a busy summer.
I think it's true that time flies when you got lots on your hand.
