It's another monthly update since July.
I think having these monthly status updates are working out quite well.
It gives me a thorough retrospect of the month and I think it helps me keep track of my progress on projects.

August wasn't really the best month compared to the recent ones.
It was a busy month at the workplace with The Board of Audit and Inspection carrying out the annual inspection.
There were also some troubles at the workplace, but I think the worst part is over and is things are getting wrapped up.
Since I am not sure if I am allowed to speak of it in unrelated environments (such as this website) I won't talk about it anymore.
However, it certainly was a new kind of challenge for me, and it did quite hinder my progress with the projects that I was working on too.

Although the progress on the projects were subtle, it wasn't halted.
I am still working on the [SXC](https://github.com/thinkty/sxc) - Simple XMPP Chat.
Earlier this month, I was stuck on what to do next as I didn't have a clear picture of how the application will interact with various internal components.
A great solution was to draw out a horrible mix of a state diagram and a sequence diagram.

It's not the prettiest diagram nor the clearest, but it surely did serve its purpose of providing me with a vague blueprint of how the application was going to work.
From there on, based on the diagram, I added tasks to the project board and implemented the necessary internals.
Seems like I did a lot, but the results seems to disagree.
Since the minimalistic UI and the TLS networking to an XMPP server seems to be working as expected, I think I am finally ready to implement the blocked queues for in/outbound messages and actually get in some actions with the XMPP protocols.

In a side note, I found the TLS stuff to be quite interesting while working on this project.
So, I plan to actually go deep into the rabbit hole of how SSL/TLS actually works to get a better grasp of it.
Currently, I feel like I am just calling methods from a library like a robot.
Instead, I want to know how cert verification actually works, what X.509 certs are, the various cipher suites, hostname verifications, and tons more.
Even if it might take time, I feel like this might be one of the best moments in my life where I can actually take some time to learn new things as I am not in school or work.

The [Gundam Universal Century](https://github.com/thinkty/gundam-uc) guide that I am working on is also on the verge of first release.
The React components are almost finished, and I am now filling in the information for each series/movie.
I hope to make a release soon and perhaps update the README from the template.

In conclusion, although I said the month was slow and grumpy, I think I made a lot of progress.
