Hello there!

My name is **Tae Yoon Kim** and I'm a **sophomore in computer science** at **Purdue University**.

I'm currently taking the **Software Engineering** track and I am also interested in taking the **Systems Software** track.
However, right now, I am trying to widen the spectrum to find what I really want to do.

Personally, I feel like trying out various projects is the best way to find out what really interests me.
So naturally, I started some projects with simple a [**Desktop Application**](https://github.com/thinkty/Journey) in **Java**/**JavaFX**, [**Android**](https://github.com/thinkty/simple-todo-android) and **Web** such as [**React**](https://github.com/thinkty/feeder) and [**Node.js**](https://github.com/thinkty/dialogflow-tester).

Currently, I'm working on much bigger web projects, and I'm also learning how to use the **Qt** framework alongside with a **Raspberry Pi** project.

As I progress with my projects, I intend to post updates to this blog and I also plan to post projects that I did in school, my thoughts on some subjects other than CS, and even hobbies!

Thanks for coming to my About page!
