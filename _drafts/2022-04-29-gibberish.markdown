> unintelligible or meaningless speech or writing; nonsense.

It's been a while since I wrote something else than a status update or a project post.
So, I wanted to write something else and decided to start a new series called *Gibberish*.
In this series, I will talk about a topic that has absolutely no value, is a complete waste of time and space, and contributes to creating another unnecessary traffic in the internet.
One might wonder about the reasons behind such futile action, but I also have no clue.
I just do it because I can and I will now begin my first gibberish.

Recently, the word "multiverse" has gotten quite popular.
Used in various contexts, the word "multiverse" can simply be another unnecessary buzzword created by the marketing department, an interesting plot to a media, or something else.
Sometimes, multiverse is used as a synonym to "parallel universe", "parallel dimension", etc.
The terms above are sci-fis best friends.
A lot of books, films and cartoons (just media in general) use parallel dimension, multiverse, alternate reality, etc in the plot.
This got me curious to whether if we are actually living in a parallel dimension or just this **one**.
From this point on, nothing is supported by scientific facts and it's just all gibberish that came from my thought which might or might not have been affected by other forms of media or just sensory inputs through my subconscious mind.
In simple words, what I'm about to talk about should just be taken with a grain of salt.

Many say we live in a **three** dimensional world.
No matter how small, everything has height, length, and width <sub><sup>(or does it?)</sup></sub>.
If there is **three** dimensional world, then there should also be worlds with different dimensions such as **two** dimension or even **seven**!!
In a two dimensional world, an object might just have two: height and width.

Now, can a three dimensional being interact with a two dimensional being?
To a three dimensional being, a two dimensional being would just be like a flat painting or this post that you are reading through your flat screen.
However, to a two dimensional being, can it see (or sense? idk maybe they might not use visual clues) the three dimensional being?
Probably not because it is not overlapping.
