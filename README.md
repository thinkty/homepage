MeerKats is the name of my personal blog where I post my projects and thoughts.
It has been implemented using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it is using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

Meerkats are the cutest animals thus the title and the name of my blog.

On the *projects* tab, you can see my past projects (ongoing projects are here at Github). In addition to the projects, most of my posts will be on the *thoughts* tab where I usually write about almost all kinds of things starting from hobbies, tutorials, game reviews, and more.
