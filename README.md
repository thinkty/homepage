# MeerKats
![build](https://travis-ci.com/thinkty/homepage-jekyll.svg?branch=master)

MeerKats is the name of my personal blog where I post my projects, thoughts, and hobbies.
It has been implemented using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it is using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

Meercats are the cutest animals IMO thus the title & name of my blog.
I regularly post updates on my projects, some random thoughts that I want to save in my blog, and also hobbies such as games and movies!
