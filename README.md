# Homepage
![build](https://travis-ci.com/thinkty/homepage-jekyll.svg?branch=master)

This my personal blog where I post my projects and thoughts.
It is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

## Categories
Currently, there are two categories to the blog: *projects* and *thoughts*.

### Projects
Here, you can see my projects with short descriptions about the project and details into the layout.

### Thoughts
Most of my posts will be here where I write about almost all kinds of things starting from hobbies, tutorials, games, and more.
