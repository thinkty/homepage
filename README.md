# Homepage

This my personal blog where I post my projects and updates.
It is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

## Categories
Currently, there are two categories to the blog: *projects* and *updates*.

### Projects
Here, you can see my projects with short descriptions about the project and details into the layout.

### Updates
Most of my posts will be here where I write about almost all kinds of things starting from hobbies, tutorials, games, and more.

## Installation
Make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).

Install the dependencies
```
bundle install
```
Run it locally to see how it looks
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Make sure to run
```
bundle exec jekyll build
```
before deploying to replace the `localhost`s in the links

## Overriding Styles
Edit the [assets/css/main.scss](https://github.com/thinkty/homepage/blob/master/assets/css/main.scss) file to override the previous styles.
Find the `classname` or `id` through the inspector of your browser and add/edit to main.scss to your taste.
